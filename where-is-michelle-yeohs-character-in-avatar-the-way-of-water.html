In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, she expressed her eagerness to work with Cameron in the upcoming film and that she can’t speak much about her role in the film until it comes out in December.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>Many kept their eyes out for Yeoh in the movie, but it seemed like her character was nowhere to be seen.</p><h2 id=h-where-is-michelle-yeoh-s-character-in-avatar-the-way-of-water data-injectable=false>Where is Michelle Yeoh’s character in ‘Avatar: The Way of Water?’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Everything-Everywhere-All-at-Once-e1678704023519.jpg><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>No, your eyes didn’t deceive you. Unfortunately, Yeoh didn’t make an appearance in the Avatar: The Way of Water. It seems that her character may have been removed from the final-cut of the film, robbing fans of the opportunity to see her.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>But all hope isn’t lost.
