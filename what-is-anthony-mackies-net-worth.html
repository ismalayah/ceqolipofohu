Mackie had high aspirations from the very start, graduating from the North Carolina School of the Arts’ high school program before heading to Julliard. After graduating in 2001, the New Orleans native got his first big acting break barely one year later as Eminem’s primary antagonist, Papa Doc, in 8 Mile. His first major role came just one year later with the LGBTQ indie movie Brother to Brother, which showcased his talents and landed him several nominations. Despite appearing in Million Dollar Baby and the Manchurian candidate in 2004, it wouldn’t be until 2009 that Mackie would win his first award.</p><p data-characters=817 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>His role as Sergeant J. T. Sanborn in The Hurt Locker alongside his Marvel costar and good friend, Jeremy Renner, earned Mackie his first award for Best Supporting Actor. The next few years saw Mackie involved in a number of high-profile projects like Eagle Eye, Man on a Ledge, and the Adjustment Bureau. None of his previous projects could compare to his 2014 role in Captain America and the Winter Soldier as Sam Wilson. His first appearance as the superhero only paid $100,000 but by the time Mackie appeared in Falcon and the Winter Soldier, the actor’s time was worth almost $500,000 per episode. Now that Anthony Mackie is officially the new Captain America, it’s only a matter of time before he starts raking in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">big bucks like Chris Pratt</a>, but for now, he’s sitting at a very comfortable $8 million.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Outside of the Marvel-verse, Mackie recently starred alongside Brooklyn 99’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephanie Beatriz</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twisted Metal</a>, and opened his own restaurant, NoBar, in 2011. Unfortunately, both locations closed in 2015, but we’d like to think it was due to his almost overnight explosion of popularity thanks to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGjwam7zbJkppmToLamv4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
