That was entirely by design, with intimacy coordinator David Thackerary explaining to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wrap </a>that despite having less work to do, the storylines and characters were always going to take precedence.</p><p>“I was also like, Hey, where’s all the work? Where’s all my scenes? But like it actually makes sense for the season. It’s about other things. It’s about other journeys, not necessarily all about the intimacy. This season felt different from the previous ones. There’s a real maturity for the characters’ journey now. You can really feel the difference from Season 2 to where they are now. Enjoy seeing your favorite characters on screen one last time. Enjoy the stories that are told and for what Sex Education is all about, and take one fundamental lesson which is make sure you have consent and have open communication with your partner.”</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>There was far too much narrative heavy lifting to be done for Sex Education to spend an excessive amount of time in the bedroom – or wherever its raunchy roster of favorites tend to do their business – but it hardly sanded down its edges before bowing out, either.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsdhmrqGdoprAbq3LpWStoJVixLC%2BymauoZ2imsBurculZKaxXaiwprrErGStoJVitq%2FAyKaYnLFdmLywvsOipZqsn6d6sLqMmmSrmaWjsKnFjKecrZ6cnsVussCvpquhpJp6qa3PqbBmrJ9iwKrAjKilZqyYmnq0tcOeo6Kmlah8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
