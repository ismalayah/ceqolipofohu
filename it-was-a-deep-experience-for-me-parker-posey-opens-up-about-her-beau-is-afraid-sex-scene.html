The 54-year-old stated while comparing&nbsp;Beau is Afraid‘s script to poetry,&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the movie has a lot of poetry to it, and it’s just very effective. I don’t know why certain images stay with me, but I can meditate on them and go like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s in my psyche. That’s in my universe.'”</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Further in the conversation, Posey recounts the infamous sex scene with Phoenix. The&nbsp;Scream 3&nbsp;star shared that it was a “deep experience” for her and that she couldn’t imagine anyone else participating in that scene. Still, this wasn’t unusual for Posey because of her unpredictable career choices. She said,&nbsp;</p><p>“No one [else] would do this, and no one could do this. My career, my path, is of the unexpected. I don’t know how to explain it other than it was a deep experience for me.”</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Since&nbsp;Beau is Afraid’s&nbsp;theatrical debut last month, the horror <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">received rave reviews from fans and critics alike</a>. Although many agreed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this film is an acquired taste</a> and that people should be mindful before watching it, many complimented Phoenix’s delivery and the director Ari Aster’s overall vision.&nbsp;In addition to the praise,&nbsp;Beau is Afraid&nbsp;also got a 70% on the Tomatometer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=53 data-injectable=false>Beau is Afraid&nbsp;is now playing in theaters.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooK1lp5bAbq2MnZyeqF2axbGx0aKcp5uVYrOwvoymnGaokae4pr6MqaasnalivLGxzaxkrqhdlq%2BwwdNmn56qXZeyosGMoqpmmZanrqqwjKycsWWjmLKvsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
