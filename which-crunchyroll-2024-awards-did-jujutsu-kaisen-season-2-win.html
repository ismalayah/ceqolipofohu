In Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 he worked as director and on Storyboard for Ending 2 and 5 episodes, Episode Director for episodes 1, 18, and 23, Unit Director for Ending 2, and was in charge of Key Animation in 7 episodes (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimeNewsNetwork</a>)</li><li><strong>Best Character Design</strong>: It seems like the slight changes and adjustments in animation style and character design for season 2 were to the series’ benefit.</li><li>Last but certainly the most anticipated award, <strong>Anime of the Year 2024</strong>.
