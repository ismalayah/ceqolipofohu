This scope speaks to the breadth of issues, and the various ways in which human beings have harmed Earth's systems, some of which are&nbsp;beyond return.&nbsp;But that fleeting screen-time proves counter-intuitive as it doesn’t dig into the topics with a great deal of information, nor does it create much of an emotional connection beyond what one already has before hitting play.&nbsp;</p><p>“Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet” only sounds like a mish-mash title.&nbsp;Scientist <a href=#>Johan Rockström</a> has devised a concept of boundaries, in which we cross certain lines of harming the Earth with regards to levels of biodiversity, ocean acidification, or nutrients. The documentary touts this as its big original idea to add to the global warming documentary pile, and our “crossing” of said boundaries is shown with animation of people who look like they’re marching over one big “<a href=#>Saturday Night Fever</a>” dance floor with rows of squares that go from green to yellow and then a no-return red. "Breaking Boundaries"&nbsp;loves to cram in its metaphors (global warming is equated to dominos, or to a train with no brakes&nbsp;about to go down a hill), and it loves and repeats this image the most.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The film was directed by <a href=#>Jon Clay</a>, and yet I would not question it if you told me that was a pen name for Netflix. More than a lot of Netflix Originals,&nbsp;“Breaking Boundaries” seems specifically made for the touch-and-go attention span that the streaming service cultivates, while trying to make talking head moments extra flashy by putting stuff around them.&nbsp;There are&nbsp;too many&nbsp;goofy examples of an earnest intellectual (Rockström) giving a speech, and then the filmmakers going buck-wild with the green-screen canvas behind him as if this were classy "Tim and Eric." If it’s not the thousands of&nbsp;nervous systems that flare up&nbsp;next to Rockström and distract from his words, it’s how his face is&nbsp;super-imposed over fires and other disasters, followed by other in-your-face graphics,&nbsp;all for the sake of simply looking busy.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bqZ6Zm567qHnBqKynnJGntqa%2FjK2fnmWjmLamusKeZKieXaTCs3nPpZinnaRif3F%2BkA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
