In June 2022, Leon shared on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;revealed that they were transgender. "So here's me ... to let you know that I am trans. My name is Leon or Leo (I love both) and my pronouns are they/them," Leon wrote. Without getting too specific, Leon spoke about their childhood and the challenges that they had to overcome. "I remember the first time that I knew I wasn't a girl," Leon went on. "Unfortunately, I grew up in a context that was incredibly gendered & restrictive. So I continued to be socialized as a girl and later a woman." But things have changed for Leon, as they have begun to embrace their true self. "And that self is incredibly genderqueer, trans, and unapologetic," they added.</p><p dir=ltr>The comments on Leon's post were supportive and had surprisingly little to do with TLC's "Sister Wives," showing that Leon's been able to separate themselves from that previous environment. Leon's partner, Audrey Kriss, is also active on social media and regularly shares happy photos of their relationship. In one <a href=#>photo</a> shared by Audrey, a fan mentioned Meri's split from Kody. "I am so happy Meri is finally going to be out of such a toxic relationship," the user commented. "I know you and Leon are beyond happy in your lives together. Please ... be the awesome in her life."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlna4B1gI6soKyslad6uLXVnqpmr5ikeqq%2FjKacq6Fdl7%2Bww82sZKimnK56pLTIpZtmpJWku3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
