Punk <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sustained a torn triceps muscle</a> in the 2024 Royal Rumble match. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> on RAW that he would miss WrestleMania as a result.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-living-the-dream>Living the dream</h2><p>Drew McIntyre using a custom version of the infamous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrow funeral meme</a> is fitting. Punk was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> injured after taking a Future Shock DDT by McIntyre in the Rumble match, which he (storyline) took credit for.</p><p>McIntyre <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Punk</a> on Monday that he’s never been a spiritual person, but he prayed for Punk’s injury and it happened. McIntyre says he targeted Punk in the Royal Rumble, and he slept like a baby after hearing he took out Punk. Now, he’s going to live CM Punk’s dream… again.</p><h2>A most compelling character</h2><p>In a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ReviewSTL</a>, Drew McIntyre discussed his current character. He described how he feels this is the most compelling he has felt as a character in a long time.</p><p>“100%. I always kind of compete with myself. I don’t really compete with anyone else on the roster. It’s just, I’ll never be number one because I’m always competing with myself. Looking across the board, WWE in general, but specifically on Raw, everybody is upping their game. Be it on the microphone, be it from a character perspective. Be it from the in-ring game. It’s awesome to see because it’s a three-hour show and it’s not easy to sit down and watch a three-hour wrestling show. It’s like watching a three-hour film, no matter how good it is, a Martin Scorcese number. ‘Wow, that was really good, but it was long.’</p><p>“These days, we have so many different characters, unique storytelling going on. For me, personally, this is the most compelling character-wise I’ve felt in a very long time because of the different approach we’re taking telling stories, which is to make it as real as possible because if it’s real to the superstar, they’re feeling it and the audience will be with them.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ29vY2Kxs7HWZqScoZ6pxrOxjKucmpukqHq1u4ykoKWkmaO0bq%2FMZqeuppuoeri%2BxKyrpZ2dlruqrYymmKKmXZrDprrTZpurnZGi</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
