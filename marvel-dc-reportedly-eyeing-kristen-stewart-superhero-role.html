Robert Pattinson, meanwhile, actively shunned big budget studio projects for a decade to reinvent himself as an acclaimed talent willing to tackle risky material, <a href=# rel=noopener>but he’s eventually circled back around again</a> to headline Matt Reeves’ The Batman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spencer-e1611754566637.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Last but not least, <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong> already had years of experience under her belt as a child star before she agreed to play Bella Swan, but her brief detour into action heroine territory in Snow White and the Hunstman was hardly rapturously received, and she’s more likely to be found in independent dramas than glossy blockbusters these days, <a href=# rel=noopener>with the notable exception of the Charlie’s Angels reboot</a>, which bombed at the box office.</p><p data-characters=647 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=false>According to insider Daniel Richtman, though, the 30 year-old is being eyed by both Marvel and DC for a superhero role. The tipster doesn’t offer any sort of clue as to who, what or when, while even the where is vague seeing as both outfits are named. <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong> will next be <a href=# rel=noopener>seen as Princess Diana in Spencer</a>, though, which really looks like it could go either way at this stage to turn out as an awards-baiting prestige drama or a laughable misfire in the same vein as Naomi Watts’ 2013 flop Diana. After that, however, her schedule is clear, so we’ll just have to wait and see if she pitches up in a comic book franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJqqppq5brDCZqmeqJ%2Bnwaawy7JknrGVnruoecqroKyslaN6tMDEsJirrF2owrGx0aGcq6ddp7ytsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
