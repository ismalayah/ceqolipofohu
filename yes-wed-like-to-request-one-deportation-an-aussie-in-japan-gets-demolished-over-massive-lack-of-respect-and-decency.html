This viral <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TikTok</strong></a> proves just how obnoxious it can be to be ignorant of new cultural customs and the exact reason why locals often detest travelers.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=664 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>An Australian travel content creator posted a video about his travels through Japan. In the clip, he’s taking a train to his next location and notices a woman-only car. It’s clearly labeled in Japanese and English, but for some reason, he felt the need to walk through the car himself to see if it really was just women. The signage was proven correct by the panoramic video he took of every woman in the train car while he walked through it. He commented that he was shocked to see such a “conservative” concept in a country like Japan, even saying “It’s like Saudi Arabia in here,” and calling himself a woman inspector.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@shearingshedvlogs href=#>@shearingshedvlogs</a><p>This “women-only” carriage is the last thing I would expect to be seeing in such a free country like Japan and reminds me of something I would see in a country with strict segregation rules.

Several people pointed out that people like him give tourists a bad reputation agreeing that a woman-only car is really for the best. Others pointed out that the whole point of the car was to make women feel safe, and his actions probably made them feel quite the opposite. Commenters were seriously quick to tell off the TikToker for his actions, “What a disrespectful and condescending white dude. The purpose is for women to feel safe, it’s not mandatory segregation,” someone commented.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>The video even made its way over to Twitter where people were ready to double down on viewers’ scolding, one person even suggesting that the TikToker get booted from Japan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hi, Japanese Immigration Agency?

The carriages did receive some controversy and a lot of men complained that they had made the rest of the train more crowded. However, lots of people came to their defense and women have used them ever since. There are now women-only carriages on 87 lines and within 32 railway companies.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Violating a safe space like this one is the exact reason that doing research before traveling to a new country is a vital step in avoiding faux pas like this one. Hopefully, when you travel, you have a little more common sense than this guy. But if you don’t, it may be best just to stay home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8urHSZq6enF2htqyxjK2mZqqVpsKmv9NmpqedXZmysbvRrZitoZ%2BjeqK6jJqsrKuZmnqquoyjmKmZnmK0psDSZpuepZ%2BhtrS0xJ1kqK6Vp3qurdKsoK%2BdXaGupLeMqJ1mqpWovaav02aYp5xdmbKksc2csGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
