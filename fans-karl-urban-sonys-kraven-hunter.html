Chandor. And while the 56 year-old action icon had been approached for the title role, the legendary big game hunter just doesn‚Äôt feel like an obvious fit for the actor‚Äôs established screen persona.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=606 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>There was plenty of speculation last year that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergei Kravinoff was on his way to the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> to track down the fugitive Peter Parker in Spider-Man 3, but the multiverse seemed to draw a line under that. It‚Äôs unclear what the character‚Äôs upcoming solo outing will bring us, but Chandor is a solid filmmaker that‚Äôs delivered strong work in a variety of genres including financial thriller Margin Call, survival drama All is Lost and crime story A Most Violent Year, making him an intriguingly exciting choice to helm a big budget superhero pic with a bad guy in the lead.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>Of course, Keanu Reeves is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">almost guaranteed to show up in a Marvel blockbuster</a> at some stage in the near future, but Kraven the Hunter shouldn‚Äôt be it.
