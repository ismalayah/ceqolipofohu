I would even be willing to bet that you’ve heard about it way before its 2022 debut. I surely did, because the anime is based on a successful manga and light novel series of the same name. Don’t get it twisted, though — the anime adaptation has its own merits.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>After managing to impress longtime fans and hooking new viewers to the story with season 1, The Eminence in Shadow a second installment was announced in early 2023. Needless to say, the news was received with open arms and after months of waiting, season 2 has finally premiered. Now, the only thing that stands between you and the new episodes is finding out where to stream the anime.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Can I stream The Eminence in Shadow on Crunchyroll?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, The Eminence in Shadow is not available for streaming on Crunchyroll right now. What Crunchyroll does have on its website, however, is The Eminence in Shadow: Master of Garden, and anime RPG game, so if that’s up your alley, now is as good a time as any to try it. That’s not really what you’re here for, though, is it?</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>The fact that the series is not on Crunchyroll is tragic news, I know, especially for those who rely on this streaming platform for all their anime needs. Crunchyroll is by far the biggest and most well-known anime streaming service out there, so folks tend to panic when the series they want can’t be found <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in its vast catalog</a>. It’s normal, I get it, but perhaps you should consider this an opportunity to expand your horizons. It’s time — and luckily for you, there is another way to watch this anime.</p><h2 id=h-where-to-stream-the-eminence-in-shadow data-injectable=false>Where to stream The Eminence in Shadow</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Sentai Filmworks acquired the distribution rights for The Eminence in Shadow seasons 1 and 2, which means that both are available for streaming on HIDIVE.
