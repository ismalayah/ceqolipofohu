You immediately have more content to consume without having to wait around for another season! <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Good Omens</strong></a> fans know this all too well.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Those who got hooked on the eccentric and imaginative Good Omens universe via the hit Prime Video series of the same name are likely on cloud nine following <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the announcement of a third season</a>. Of course, the show’s return to our screens is likely a ways away, however. Luckily, the excellent source material from the late Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman (also EP of the series) is sitting right there.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>But with season 3 confirmed to be the last, meaning the TV show has the shape of a perfectly formed trilogy, it begs the question: How many books are there in the Good Omens series?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-the-total-number-of-good-omens-books data-injectable=false>What is the total number of Good Omens books?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Michael-Sheen-Good-Omens.png><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Back in 1990, when Gaiman’s comic book magnum opus The Sandman was only a year in and the much-missed Pratchett was already 10 books into his epic Discworld universe, the novice writer joined forces with the veteran to pen Good Omens, retroactively giving us a collaboration between two giants of the fantasy genre. Sadly, however, that was the only book the pair ever published together.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Since the first book was released, both Pratchett and Gaiman’s careers kept them increasingly busy with their own independent projects. For starters, Gaiman lived in the U.S. as Pratchett resided in the U.K. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> explained, they just never had the opportunity to set aside the time to pen the sequel before Pratchett died in 2015.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>However, the pair had laid out the blueprints for a sequel, one they “fully intended to write,” according to a blog post by Gaiman on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his website</a>. While there remains only a single Good Omens novel, the existence of seasons 2 and 3 of the TV series has allowed Gaiman to finally bring his and Pratchett’s blueprints for the further adventures of Aziraphale and Crowley to life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpJqmqWK0sLvDZqamnZ6oeqO7zqSqZpmimnq1tMSrnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
