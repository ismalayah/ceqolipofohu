Time and time again, we’ve witnessed this recurring phenomenon in Hollywood: a promising biographical film that initially garners attention as potential Oscar bait, only to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fade into relative obscurity months</a> after its debut on the big screen. Take Blonde and Bohemian Rhapsody <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as lackluster instances of semi-failed biopics.</a></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>One of the latest additions to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this extensive list of biopics</a> is Elvis. Needless to say, the entire marketing campaign, centered around Austin Butler’s method-acting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">became even more iconic</a> than the film itself. And, that was not the only recent biopic to tackle the interesting lives of the Presley family. Priscilla was recently released in theatres and has generated a lot of buzz.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Starting with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Elordi</a></strong> as Elvis Presley, whose differences from the 1950s grandeur star only prove to be the perfect casting, even with their height difference.</p><h2 id=h-is-jacob-elordi-taller-than-elvis-presley data-injectable=false>Is Jacob Elordi taller than Elvis Presley?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Needless to say, Presley wasn’t known for his height, as much as he was infamously known for his hip thrusts and velvety voice. As we’ll soon see in Coppola’s retelling of the story, he was also known for taking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a keen interest in underage girls</a>, but that’s an entirely different story in and of itself. Nevertheless, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Presley</a> was indeed quite tall.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>One might not have been able to discern this at the time, with analog screens in black and white altering the perception of size for those watching, but Presley was, in fact, very tall. This is, at least by 1950s standards.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>The singer rose to prominence in 1956, two years after signing with the Sun Records label in Memphis, when he was just 21 years old. By then, he already stood at 6′0″ (182cm), while the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">average American male height</a> hovered around 5’7” (171cm) back then.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Taking this into consideration, Presley was actually considered quite tall for his time, and even by today’s standards. However, Elordi still towers over Presley by a few inches—well, he would if the singer were alive today. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Euphoria actor</a> currently stands at 6’5” (196 cm), making him notably taller than Presley – by 5 inches.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=false>On the other hand, the actress portraying Priscilla Presley —<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Cailee Spaeny </a>— is actually shorter than Priscilla herself. Spaeny stands at 5’1” (155 cm), while Priscilla is 5’4” (163cm). The height difference in the film will surely be a lot more noticeable than Priscilla and Elvis’ own height <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">at the time of their marriage</a>, making Elordi and Spaeny to be casting choices already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">being praised</a> by netizens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG62wJymm2WVobyzsMhmmqiloJa%2FprCMraZmnZyrtrR5z6ucrKSVrnq1tMRmp6uho5i2rbjAZpicrJ%2BnwG60xKKeoaxdmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
