With that, here’s every legacy Indiana Jones character in Dial of Destiny.</p><h2 id=h-indiana-jones data-injectable=false>Indiana Jones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-2.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Surprise, surprise; Indiana Jones appears in the Indiana Jones film. I won’t spend too long here since this entry is effectively a formality, though it is worth mentioning that Dial of Destiny shows a very different shade of the action hero we all grew up with.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sallah</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-sallah.png><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>John Rhys-Davies reprises his role as Sallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir, Indy’s longtime friend who aided him during the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Dial of Destiny sees Sallah’s screentime reduced from what we’re used to, appearing early on to get Indy out of a pinch by helping him get overseas to Morocco, where Helena has taken the Antikythera. He appears later on at end to visit Indy as he’s recovering from his injuries.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Marion Ravenwood</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-marion-ravenwood.png><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>Karen Allen also reappears as Marion Ravenwood, Indy’s spunky love interest that first appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark, now his wife from whom he’s separated.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Her screentime is even less than Sallah’s, only appearing at the conclusion when Helena calls her to Indy’s apartment in hopes that the two will be able to reconcile the tension that pulled them apart. Despite the fleeting nature of her appearance, she does create one scene with the hero that longtime Indiana Jones fans are sure to gush over.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Mutt Williams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mutt-williams-indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull.jpg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Rounding out the list of veteran Jones players in Dial of Destiny is Mutt Williams, who doesn’t physically appear, but is mentioned a couple of times throughout. That said, the impact he has on Dial of Destiny‘s state of affairs is nothing to sneeze at.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>We find out that Mutt enlisted in the military, and was killed overseas while fighting in the Vietnam War. The resulting grief that engulfed Marion and Indy proved to be too much for their relationship, which explains the couple’s separation, and more importantly, the relatively unsightly state of Indy’s life before Helena came knocking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXaeytcHRp6Cnn12eu6W1wKeYZqKfo7K0ecKhmKuZk6mys7%2BMoqVmnJmWuW67xWabnquknru6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
