Dong-Eun was never looking for money as an end in itself, but only as a means to the end she wanted to bring upon those who bullied her to the cruelest and most traumatic extents during high school.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>The series was divided into two parts. Part 1 arrived in late December 2022, and Part 2 came out a couple of months later in Mar. 2023. Part 2 brought Dong-eun’s revenge to its conclusion. Every single one of her bullies met the appropriate divine judgment she set into motion by Dong-eun’s clever planning, each suffering to differing degrees according to how much suffering they had imposed onto her all those years back.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Dong-eun’s quest for revenge is completed. However, her loyal accomplice and now-lover, Yeo-Jeong, has yet to realize his revenge for the killing of his selfless father, even though, as we can see at the end of the last episode, the power couple is well on their way to once again enact justice with their hands.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>The ending wraps things up neatly while leaving it open-ended enough for fans to fill in the gaps as they wish. Or, perhaps, the ending serves another purpose: that of setting up for a second season.</p><h2 id=h-can-we-hope-to-see-more-of-dong-eun-and-yeo-jeong-s-story data-injectable=false>Can we hope to see more of Dong-Eun and Yeo-Jeong’s story?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Design-sem-nome-2023-12-17T150735.103.png><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>A second season or part 3 of The Glory has not yet been confirmed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=985 data-injectable=true>It seems to me that if they wanted to renew it they already would have. And I’d go further to say that perhaps it’s not <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix executives who are not willing to do it</a>, as they would surely be happy to capitalize on the show’s huge success, but maybe the creator, Kim Eun-sook, isn’t willing to sacrifice quality for profit. She seems satisfied with the answer she got to with the end of Part 2, which lays out the most important payoffs and gives closure where it’s due, while still leaving some room for the viewers’ imagination to pave the rest of Dong-eun and Yeo-jeong’s path for them.</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=37 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, the writer said:</p><p>“When I was writing the script, I was trying to find an answer to that question. And if my daughter is beaten to death, there might be a solution and that solution would be pulling all the perpetrators to hell, because I have the money to do so. So my conclusion was that it would be better for me if you’re beaten. But in The Glory, this can’t happen to Dong-eun, right? And I think most of the victims can’t solve the problem like this because they don’t have wealthy parents like me.</p><p>They don’t live in an environment where my daughter is raised. So I wanted to cheer for them because reality is harsh. And I hope Dong-eun’s vengeance is successful. So that’s how I tried to lead my storyline toward. And how it ends, you should watch it yourselves.”</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Nevertheless, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s impossible. The series renewal status is still pending. But as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a viewer and Redditor wrote</a>: “I think it would be hard to bring a season 2. A spin-off that covers Yeo-Jeong’s revenge seems more appropriate.”</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=false>For now at least, whether there’s going to be a part 3 or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a shorter spin-off</a>, remains undetermined, neither possibility being fully off the table.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9aio6VlpJ2ys7GMm5xmrJiaeqi4zquwZquVlsCwuoxrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
