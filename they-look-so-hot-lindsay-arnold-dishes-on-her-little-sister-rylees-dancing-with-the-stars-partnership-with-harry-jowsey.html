Joining the cast at just 18 years old, the talented dancer will make history as one of the youngest pros to compete in the hit competition series, jumping straight to the professional dancer role rather than spending time in the dance troupe.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>While this will be Rylee’s first time competing on Dancing with the Stars, she served as a pro on&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars: Juniors&nbsp;back in 2018, placing second overall alongside&nbsp;Miles Brown&nbsp;of&nbsp;Black-ish — we can’t wait to see her put her stellar choreography skills to good use five years later!</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>While Harry and Rylee are arguably the most-talked-about pair that will be hitting the ballroom this fall (and also one of the best-looking duos — their promo photos are seriously to die for), what does Rylee’s big sister think of this pairing?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@theeweeklytrash href=#>@theeweeklytrash</a><p>TEAM @Rylee arnold & @Harry Jowsey all the way!!! <a title=dwts href=#>#dwts</a> <a title=weeklytrashpodcast href=#>#weeklytrashpodcast</a> <a title=harryjowsey href=#>#harryjowsey</a> <a title=ryleearnold href=#>#ryleearnold</a> <a title=lindsayarnold href=#>#lindsayarnold</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Josie Van Dyke" href=#>♬ original sound – Josie Van Dyke</a></figure><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thee Weekly Trash</a> podcast with Josie Van Dyke, Lindsay dished about her sister’s addition to the Dancing with the Stars cast for season 32, as well as her oh-so-sexy partner.</p><p>“The coolest thing ever happened literally today, the day we’re recording. Finally, the news is out that my baby sister, Rylee, is going to be a pro on Dancing with the Stars this season I can’t even tell you how proud I am and how pumped I am about this. Like, I really do feel like I’m more excited about this than I was for myself.”</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>Given that the duo is related to one another (and seriously as close as can be), fans of the franchise have speculated that Lindsay had a hand in getting her younger sister cast for the show, however, the former Dancing with the Stars pro put the rumors to rest.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>“I’ve already started to see people saying like, ‘It’s cause Lindsay’s on the show’ [and] I’m like, ‘Do you think that I have a hand? Do you think I have that much control over Dancing with the Stars?’ and I think some people do think that I have that,” the 29-year-old pointed out.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>The duo then proceeded to discuss the Harry-Rylee pairing, with Josie saying that in their promo photos, “[she] was like, ‘Oh my gosh. You guys are so hot.'”</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>Naturally, Lindsay concurred: “They look so hot.”</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>When Josie joked about Harry and Rylee potentially locking lips during their time on Dancing with the Stars, Lindsay described herself as the “overprotective sister for sure,” uttering the words “don’t kiss my sister” — how funny is that?</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=false>To watch the attractive pair hit the dance floor together for the very first time, be sure to tune into the season 32 premiere of&nbsp;Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;on Tuesday, Sept. 26, at 8pm ET/PT on ABC or Disney Plus. After that, catch brand new episodes weekly to see the duo dance their way to the top.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMSyZKWnn6B6tLuMoaatZZyeu6W%2FwLJkmqqepLmlecOiqqGdo2K8r3nHnqlmpJmpwa2xjKygrKyVp3qzxcuenKxllJa7pLXNoGSwoaSderW0xGaqrZmiqHqxrdGtpZ6qo522sXnWoquhZZiWv7PFjKOmsKuVrnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
