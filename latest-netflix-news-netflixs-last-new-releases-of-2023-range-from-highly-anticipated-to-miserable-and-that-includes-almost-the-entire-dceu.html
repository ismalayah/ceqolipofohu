From a less-than-ideal new release, the coveted return of a South Korean horror staple after three years, to the world’s second-biggest superhero franchise and a good ol’ British crime mystery, chilly November, December, and January are looking stacked for Netflix enjoyers.</p><h2 id=h-the-great-warner-bros-netflix-pilgrimage-continues-as-dc-s-failed-attempt-at-a-cinematic-universe-makes-its-way-to-the-tudum-platform data-injectable=false>The great Warner Bros. – Netflix pilgrimage continues, as DC’s failed attempt at a cinematic universe makes its way to the TUDUM platform</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wonder-woman-justice-league.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>The licensing deal between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which has seen multiple high-profile titles join the latter’s catalog, has just gotten wilder. The studios that own Netflix’s main competitor, Max, seem to have forgone exclusive rights to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most of the movies in the DC Extended Universe</a>, presumably in favor of giving them a second chance at life on the neighboring platform.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Netflix has announced that, come Dec. 1, Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Justice League (not the Zack Snyder one), Birds of Prey, Wonder Woman: 1984, AND The Suicide Squad are all going to be available to stream for its 247.2 million paid subscribers, who must probably be questioning the worth of their Max membership right about now. That is, if they even have one.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Fair enough; lending Netflix the likes of Ballers, Band of Brothers, and Insecure is one thing, but the cinematic universe of one of two leading comic book brands on Earth is a completely different ballgame. What’s next, Game of Thrones and Succession?</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Not every Netflix user was particularly fond of the news. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The unrelenting Zack Snyder fandom</a>, which has been begging the red streamer to buy the Snyderverse and give it continuity, was left feeling understandably betrayed; not only were their wishes ignored, but Warner Bros. didn’t even give Netflix the permission to stream the Snyder cut version of the disgraced Justice League.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Three years after premiering, a South Korean streaming pioneer gets a Season 2 date</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>If you think the Stranger Things hiatuses were long, just count your blessings that you’re not a Sweet Home fan. The Netflix show premiered all the way back in 2020 to acclaim and a groundbreaking reception that made it the first Korean-language original to make the platform’s U.S. Top 10.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>The apocalyptic horror wouldn’t be renewed until 18 months later, and has only now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">received a release date for its coveted second season.</a> The zombie residents of the Green Home apartment complex are finally dragging themselves back to screens worldwide on Dec. 1. At least season 3 has already been greenlit as well. Let’s just hope it doesn’t take another three years before we get a glimpse of that as well.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>Song Kang is returning as the charismatic protagonist Cha Hyun-soo. Lee Jin-uk, Lee Si-young, Ko Min-si, Park Gyu-young, and more also star.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ring in the New Year with Harlan Coben’s eighth adaptation for Netflix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fool-me-once-netflix.jpg><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true><a href=#>There is a new Harlan Coben adaptation coming to Netflix at the start of the new year.</a> The eighth of the prolific mystery author’s novels to be turned into an original for the streamer, Fool Me Once is based on the 2016 book of the same name, and centers on Maya Burkett, a former Special Ops pilot, bereaved by the death of her husband Joe. One day she sees him on a nanny cam playing with their daughter, plunging her into a shocking investigation.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>The eight-episode series stars Coronation Street‘s Michelle Keegan and Obsession‘s&nbsp;Richard Armitage as Maya and Joe and has been given a Jan. 1 premiere date by Netflix.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Stale World War II drama from Deadpool 3 director finally hits Netflix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/aria-ii.png><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>The director of Free Guy, The Adam Project, and Deadpool 3 would probably not be your first choice to helm a Nazi-era war drama, and it might be for good reason. Shawn Levy’s All The Light We Cannot See was not exactly embraced by critics after early screenings, and it’s not receiving much love now that it has finally joined Netflix, either.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>Taking from Anthony Doerr’s 2014 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, this four-part limited series has been called “<a href=#>messy</a>,” “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">silly</a>” and simultaneously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“undercooked” and “overwrought.”</a> The story follows Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl who lives with her father in Paris, and Werner Pfennig, a German orphan who gets drafted into the Nazi army. Their separate lives eventually cross.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Despite the source material’s acclaim, this iteration from Levy doesn’t seem to share the same magic. While it currently boasts a 92% audience score on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, 26 reviews from professional opinion-makers only rate it at an average of 31%.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZqWZpJrAtXnNnqufpJmteq%2Bx1qxkp52km7mqxNJmo5qrpGK7psOMq5ylnZGosrR5zp9ka2hiaHqzrc2gnGaeoqS6brTIoJ%2BlsV2Wu7W1wqKnmqyVmXq1u4ymoKydopavrbGMmqWdZaSdrrV5yKeapa2UmsBurcumpqysXam1pnnEp6uiqpVisaSx1Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
