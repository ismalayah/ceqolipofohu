Their new mini-album, MIC ON, is made up of three songs, with “ILLELLA” being selected as the title track to lead this new era.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>In “ILLELLA,” which was co-written and co-composed by Moonbyul, MAMAMOO is unapologetically sexy and self-assured, singing about spending the whole night “bundled up” with their lover. The song mixes reggae rhythms, with K-Pop’s usual bubbly production, and the type of stunning vocals only the ladies of MAMAMOO can produce. It’s yet another powerful track to get down to on the dance floor, by one of the most impressive groups of the last decade.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>The title was stylized as “1LLELLA” for the promotional material and is repeated constantly throughout the verses and chorus of the track, but what does it mean?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meaning-of-illella-in-korean data-injectable=false>Meaning of “Illella” in Korean</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=590 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>“Illella” is one possible romanization of the Korean word “일낼라” as featured in the music video for the song on MAMAMOO’s Youtube channel. Literally, “일낼라” is the conjugation of the verb “일내다” which, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naver’s Korean dictionary</a>, means “to provoke a problem,” or “give rise to some trouble.” In the official English subtitles for the video, as well as the most famous lyrics website online, Genius, the expression is translated to “something’s about to break.”</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>In the context of the song, “일낼라” signifies the moment just before two people finally get together, when there is rising tension, and the person singing is debating whether they should “make something happen.” The two are so infatuated with each other that there’s a feeling in the air that “something’s about to break” and finally lead to sex.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>If you enjoyed the song, check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how we would rank it among MAMAMOO’s other incredible title tracks</a>.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false>We Got This Covered’s review of MIC ON will also be available soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMrZ%2BeZaSewa2xjKidZqWRoq6uu86sZKedp2LAqrrGpZxmoZyhsq24wGaknpmeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
