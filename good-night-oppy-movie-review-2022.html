Anthropomorphizing—the&nbsp;process of investing non-human things with human traits—is the real subject of this movie, and the focus of most of its drama.&nbsp;Spirit and Opportunity&nbsp;are treated&nbsp;like people by the NASA team (and the filmmakers), in the manner of lovable cartoon characters or "<a href=#>Star Wars</a>" androids. The routines and rituals associated with&nbsp;Spirit and Opportunity (Oppy for short) contribute to the sense that these long-necked metal things&nbsp;roving the ochre surface of Mars have personalities and feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>The bulk of the&nbsp;running time&nbsp;consists of news, documentary, and home movie footage taken during&nbsp;the mission, plus interviews with key members of the team,&nbsp;but White and company got a mighty assist from expensive state-of-the-art computer effects, which re-create the Mars mission in a style that recalls "<a href=#>Wall-E</a>," "<a href=#>The Martian</a>,"&nbsp;and other science-fiction epics. Whenever there's a cut to a closeup of the camera unit atop a rover's neck, we can't help thinking of it as a face. When one of them struggles to get out of a sandy sinkhole or change course despite a busted wheel, we root for them, just as we might for Mustafa, Black Beauty, Lassie, R2-D2, or any other non-human character&nbsp;who becomes an honorary person by virtue of&nbsp;having the audience's emotions poured into them.&nbsp;</p><p>The interviewees&nbsp;describe what they were thinking and feeling&nbsp;as they tried to figure out how to get the robots from one place to another, maneuver them out of sand traps, and figure out workarounds for&nbsp;equipment failures and geographical impediments.&nbsp;They consider the years they spent&nbsp;tending to&nbsp;Spirit and Oppy to be the highlight of their lives.&nbsp;Some of the people involved in the mission were in their teens or twenties back in the aughts&nbsp;and now have children,&nbsp;and/or have endured decline and loss. Witnesses who&nbsp;compare the robots' technical problems to arthritis or Alzheimers' have good reason for using those analogies:&nbsp;they've experienced them.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gpqicXaO2qLTTZqapqKliurDCyJ5kq52mnrK4eZFpaWs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
